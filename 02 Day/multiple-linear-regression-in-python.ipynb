In linear regression, the relationship between the variables is modeled using a linear equation. This equation can be used to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.\n\nThere are several types of linear regression, including simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and polynomial regression.\n\n* **Simple linear regression:** This type of linear regression models the relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable. It is used to identify the strength of the relationship between the two variables and to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the value of the independent variable.\n\n* **Multiple linear regression:** This type of linear regression models the relationship between a dependent variable and two or more independent variables. It is used to identify the strength of the relationship between the variables and to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.\n\n* **Polynomial regression:** This type of linear regression is used to model relationships between the dependent and independent variables that are not linear. It can be used to fit a curve to the data and make predictions based on the curve.\n\nYou can find my project about simple linear regression [here](http://www.kaggle.com/code/emineyetm/simple-linear-regression-using-python).\n\n*Multiple regression* is a statistical method used to model the relationship between multiple independent variables and a dependent variable. In Python, this can be performed using the sklearn library. To use multiple regression with this library, you will first need to create a LinearRegression object, then train the model on your data using the fit() method. Once the model is trained, you can use the predict() method to make predictions on new data.\n\n* Here : Y = b0 + b1 * x1 + b2 * x2 + b3 * x3 + …… bn * xn \n* Y = Dependent variable and x1, x2, x3, …… xn = multiple independent variables ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Assumption of Regression Model :** \n* Linearity: The relationship between dependent and independent variables should be linear.\n* Homoscedasticity: Constant variance of the errors should be maintained.\n* Multivariate normality: Multiple Regression assumes that the residuals are normally distributed.\n* Lack of Multicollinearity: It is assumed that there is little or no multicollinearity in the data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Importing the libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# import warnings\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n\n# We will use some methods from the sklearn module\nfrom sklearn import linear_model\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn import metrics\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-04T13:22:12.996597Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-04T13:22:12.99769Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-04T13:22:13.008609Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-12-04T13:22:12.99764Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-12-04T13:22:13.006926Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Reading the Dataset\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/cardataset/data.csv\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-04T13:22:13.010656Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-04T13:22:13.011478Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-04T13:22:13.026717Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-12-04T13:22:13.011434Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-12-04T13:22:13.025209Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-04T13:22:13.02962Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-04T13:22:13.03033Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-04T13:22:13.045268Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-12-04T13:22:13.030288Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-12-04T13:22:13.043934Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.shape","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-04T13:22:13.047086Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-04T13:22:13.047879Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-04T13:22:13.055693Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-12-04T13:22:13.047837Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-12-04T13:22:13.054546Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(df.corr())","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-04T13:22:13.057328Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-04T13:22:13.05826Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-04T13:22:13.07247Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-12-04T13:22:13.058216Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-12-04T13:22:13.070692Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(df.describe())","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-04T13:22:13.074455Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-04T13:22:13.075183Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-04T13:22:13.10355Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-12-04T13:22:13.075139Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-12-04T13:22:13.102436Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Then make a list of the independent values and call this variable X.
