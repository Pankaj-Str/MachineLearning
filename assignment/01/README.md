### Assignment: Laptop Sales Price Prediction

**Objective:**  
The goal of this assignment is to predict the sales price of laptops based on various features using a machine learning model. You will preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis, build multiple regression models, and evaluate the model's performance.

**Dataset:**  
You are provided with a dataset containing information about different laptops, including features such as brand, model, processor type, RAM, storage, screen size, and price.

**Tasks:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Inspect the dataset for missing values, duplicates, and data types.
   - Handle missing values appropriately (e.g., imputation, removal).
   - Convert categorical variables into numerical formats using encoding techniques (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).
   - Normalize or standardize the data if necessary.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Generate descriptive statistics for the dataset.
   - Visualize the distribution of the target variable (laptop price).
   - Create visualizations to explore relationships between features and the target variable (e.g., scatter plots, box plots).
   - Identify any patterns or correlations among the features.

3. **Feature Selection:**
   - Perform feature selection to identify the most important features for predicting the laptop price.
   - Use techniques such as correlation analysis, variance threshold, or feature importance from a model.

4. **Model Building:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).
   - Build and train at least two different regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, or XGBoost).
   - Compare the performance of these models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the models on the test data.
   - Analyze the results and compare the performance of the different models.
   - Identify the best-performing model based on the evaluation metrics.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning on the best-performing model using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to further improve its accuracy.
   - Document the hyperparameter tuning process and the final model parameters.

7. **Model Interpretation:**
   - Interpret the coefficients (for linear models) or feature importance (for tree-based models) to understand the impact of each feature on the laptop price.
   - Provide insights into which features are most influential in predicting laptop prices.

8. **Final Report:**
   - Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing the entire process, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, evaluation, and interpretation.
   - Include all relevant code snippets, visualizations, and explanations.
   - Provide a conclusion with recommendations based on your findings.

**Submission Requirements:**
- Submit the Jupyter Notebook containing your code, visualizations, and explanations.
- The final report should be submitted in PDF format, summarizing your approach and findings.

**Bonus (Optional):**
- Deploy the best-performing model as a web application using Flask or Django, where users can input laptop features and get a predicted sales price.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Accuracy and robustness of the models.
- Clarity and completeness of the data preprocessing and EDA.
- Effectiveness of feature selection and model tuning.
- Quality and insightfulness of the final report.
- (Optional) Functionality and usability of the deployed web application.

**Note:** Use the dataset provided or find a publicly available dataset online, such as on Kaggle, that includes laptop features and prices.
