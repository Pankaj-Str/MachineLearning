# Hyperparameter Tuning in Advanced Machine Learning Models

Hyperparameter tuning is a critical step in the machine learning pipeline that can significantly impact the performance of models. Unlike model parameters that are learned from data, hyperparameters are set prior to training and guide the learning process. This tutorial will delve into the depths of hyperparameter tuning, focusing on advanced machine learning models such as Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks.

### 1. Introduction to Hyperparameters

Hyperparameters are the configuration settings used to tune the performance of a machine learning algorithm. They are external to the model and cannot be learned from the training data. Examples include the learning rate for training neural networks, the number of trees in a random forest, and the C parameter in SVMs.

### 2. Hyperparameter Tuning Techniques

#### Grid Search

Grid Search is an exhaustive search over a specified parameter grid. It is simple but computationally expensive as it evaluates every combination of hyperparameters.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300],
    'max_depth': [10, 20, 30],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10]
}

grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=RandomForestClassifier(), param_grid=param_grid, cv=5, n_jobs=-1)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(grid_search.best_params_)
```

#### Random Search

Random Search is a technique where a random combination of hyperparameters is selected. It can be more efficient than Grid Search because it does not evaluate all possible combinations.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV

param_dist = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300, 400, 500],
    'max_depth': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10]
}

random_search = RandomizedSearchCV(estimator=RandomForestClassifier(), param_distributions=param_dist, n_iter=100, cv=5, n_jobs=-1)
random_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(random_search.best_params_)
```

#### Bayesian Optimization

Bayesian Optimization builds a probabilistic model of the function mapping from hyperparameters to the objective and uses this model to select the most promising hyperparameters to evaluate in the true objective function.

```python
from skopt import BayesSearchCV

opt = BayesSearchCV(
    estimator = RandomForestClassifier(),
    search_spaces = param_dist,
    n_iter = 32,
    cv = 5
)
opt.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(opt.best_params_)
```

#### Genetic Algorithms

Genetic Algorithms mimic the process of natural selection to search for optimal hyperparameters. They work by evolving a population of solutions over several generations.

```python
from tpot import TPOTClassifier

tpot = TPOTClassifier(generations=5, population_size=20, cv=5, random_state=42, verbosity=2)
tpot.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(tpot.fitted_pipeline_)
```

### 3. Case Studies

#### Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)

GBMs are powerful models that can handle various types of data and achieve high accuracy. Hyperparameters for GBM include the number of boosting stages, learning rate, and maximum depth of the individual trees.

```python
from xgboost import XGBClassifier

param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200],
    'learning_rate': [0.01, 0.1, 0.2],
    'max_depth': [3, 5, 7]
}

grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=XGBClassifier(), param_grid=param_grid, cv=5, n_jobs=-1)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(grid_search.best_params_)
```

#### Support Vector Machines (SVM)

SVMs are effective in high-dimensional spaces and versatile due to their kernel trick. Key hyperparameters include the penalty parameter C and kernel type.

```python
from sklearn.svm import SVC

param_grid = {
    'C': [0.1, 1, 10, 100],
    'kernel': ['linear', 'rbf', 'poly'],
    'gamma': [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1]
}

grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=SVC(), param_grid=param_grid, cv=5, n_jobs=-1)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(grid_search.best_params_)
```

#### Neural Networks

Neural Networks are highly flexible and capable of modeling complex patterns. Hyperparameters include the number of layers, number of neurons per layer, activation functions, and learning rate.

```python
from keras.wrappers.scikit_learn import KerasClassifier
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

def create_model(optimizer='adam'):
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Dense(12, input_dim=8, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dense(8, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
    model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer=optimizer, metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

model = KerasClassifier(build_fn=create_model, verbose=0)
param_grid = {
    'batch_size': [10, 20, 40],
    'epochs': [10, 50, 100],
    'optimizer': ['SGD', 'Adam', 'Adagrad']
}

grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=model, param_grid=param_grid, cv=5, n_jobs=-1)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(grid_search.best_params_)
```
